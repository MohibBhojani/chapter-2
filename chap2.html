      <h2>BIO DATA vs RESUME</h2>  
      <p>From the above definition of biodata, it seems difficult to differentiate it from a regular resume, yet there are <strong>specific distinctions between a biodata and a resume</strong>.
          </p> 
        <p>
            <b><dfn>Resume</dfn></b> is a French word that means extract or summary. Hence, a resume summarizes the facts about an individual's personal information, such as educational background,
            hobbies<br/> and interests. It focuses on the most relevant and precise information that pertains to a certain job.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b><dfn>Biodata</dfn></b> on the other hand, focuses on personal information other than just the person's education and career experience. It includes data that are usually not present on a resume, 
            <br/>such as marital status, father's name, birth date, gender, religion, race, and nationality. Some biodata can even include physical features, like eye color or body complexion.
